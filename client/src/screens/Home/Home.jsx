          Hello! My name is Garrett and I am a software engineer. During the
          pandemic, I decided to pursue my interests and entered the software
          field. My curiosity for problem-solving and seeing how things work has
          been the driving factor in my switching careers and joining General
          Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive. The program was a 12 week
          400+ hour course in which I created four projects, one being a team
          project. The team project showed me that I love working in a team,
          collaborating, working on code, and bouncing ideas off one another in
          a group setting makes programming even more enjoyable.
