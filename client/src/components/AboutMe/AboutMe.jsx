      Hello! My name is Garrett and I am a software engineer. During the
      pandemic, I decided to pursue my interests and entered the software field.
      My curiosity for problem-solving and seeing how things work has been the
      driving factor in my switching careers and joining General Assemblyâ€™s
      Software Engineering Immersive. The program was a 12 week 400+ hour course
      in which I created four projects, one being a team project. The team
      project showed me that I love working in a team, collaborating, working on
      code, and bouncing ideas off one another in a group setting makes
      programming even more enjoyable.
